             With the ongoing times it becomes very important for us to stay positive. The negativity which has been spread outside due to the pandemic makes it more than necessary that we keep certain things in our mind and stay optimistic. Though its difficult to do so but it is the need of the hour.We can do it by keeping ourselves busy like by engaging ourselves in exercises, reading books, spending time with family, trying out new hobbies,sharing your thoughts, talking to your loved ones.   <p></p>
